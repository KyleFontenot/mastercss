## What is Master CSS? [sr-only]
### A CSS language
Master CSS is a [markup-driven](/guide/markup-driven) CSS language with smart rules allowing you to write familiar CSS using concise syntax within HTML/JSX.

Under the hood, Master CSS automatically adds [vendor prefixes](/guide/browser-support), smartly [ordering CSS rules](/guide/markup-driven#smart-rule-ordering), and more. This allows you to focus on building your website rather than spending a lot of effort writing and maintaining CSS rules.

<Demo $py={0}>
    <h1 className="fg:indigo fg:red:hover font:32 font:40@sm font:heavy m:10x text:center">Hello World</h1>
</Demo>
```html name=hero.html
<h1 class="**fg:indigo** **fg:red:hover** **font:32** **font:40@sm** **font:heavy** **m:10x** **text:center**">
    Hello World
</h1>
```
[Declaring styles](/guide/style-declarations) through the `class` attribute, attaching [selector states](/guide/state-selectors), and even base them on [applying conditionally](/guide/applying-conditionally). There's no need to write any inline style sheets, including creating external CSS files; just add syntax classes in your HTML.

You can write atomic classes `text:center` or [abstract styles](/guide/styles) `btn` based on the characteristics of your project and team.

### A CSS framework
Master CSS is a standalone CSS framework that provides various packages and solutions to expedite the development, including integrations for popular JavaScript frameworks, [code linting](#code-linting) for unifying team style, [language service](#language-service) to enhance the developer experience, [configuration](/reference/configuration) API for design systems, and [more](#main-features).

## Why Master CSS?
The reasons why to use Master CSS with an overview of features, syntax benefits, benchmarks, and a comprehensive comparison:

### Minimal CSS Output
This is a real-world benchmark of [critical CSS](https://web.dev/articles/codelab-extract-and-inline-critical-css) on page load for well-known official documentation websites.
<CriticalCSSForDocsSitesBenchmark />
According to HTTP Archive [CSS Bytes](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesCss), the sum of transfer size kilobytes of all external stylesheets requested by the page is **~82 kB**, excluding internal and inline styles.

Master CSS only injects the CSS required by the page, so the official documentation site is super tiny, about **~6 kB per page** (brotli).
{/* Reducing [critical CSS](https://web.dev/articles/codelab-extract-and-inline-critical-css) can improve page loading speed, browser rendering performance, and SEO metrics. */}

Master CSS provides three [rendering modes](/guide/rendering-modes), and you can choose according to project scale and application scenarios to meet your business needs.

One of the most unique, the [progressive rendering](/guide/rendering-modes/progressive-rendering) works by pre-rendering the critical CSS based on the element's class names and deferring the loading of the runtime engine for any future dynamic class names.
```html name=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    …
    <!-- Generate only the critical CSS required for the page. -->
    <style id="master">
+       .block {
+           display: block
+       }
    </style>
    <script src="https://cdn.master.co/css-runtime@rc" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 class="**block**">Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
This ensures the page generates the ultra-lightweight CSS and the fastest first-page render, unlike traditionally bundling styles across the entire application.

Initially, Master CSS was intended to create a CSS engine for production browser runtimes, so we concentrated on performance such as syntax parsing, rule generation, cache sharing, and even browser rendering.

Master CSS doesn't use heavy-duty build tools like PostCSS, Autoprefixer, or any minifiers, as these rules are generated with optimization.

### Custom Design Systems
Master CSS provides a set of systematic [configuration](/reference/configuration) APIs to help you build a consistent, easy-to-manage, and scalable design system:

We've built a series of neutral tokens in the default configuration and created a universal Master Design System, which make your design system on top of or use it as a quick starting point.
<DesignVariables />
This is just one part; more design variables and tokens are scattered throughout the syntax documentation.

For example, the utility class `capitalize` is used to simplify `css text-transform: capitalize`:
<Demo $py={0}>
    <DemoPanel>
        <DemoP><b className="bg:stripe-pink">H</b>eavy <b className="bg:stripe-pink">B</b>oxes <b className="bg:stripe-pink">P</b>erform <b className="bg:stripe-pink">Q</b>uick <b className="bg:stripe-pink">W</b>altzes <b className="bg:stripe-pink">A</b>nd <b className="bg:stripe-pink">J</b>igs.</DemoP>
    </DemoPanel>
</Demo>
```html
<p class="**capitalize**">Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs.</p>
```

### Innovative Syntax Highlighting
Master CSS is the first language to highlight class names fully, making identifying their properties, appearance, and state faster.

(!) Do you find writing utility classes sometimes seem lengthy or hard to read?
<Demo $py={0}>
    <DemoPanel>
        <code className="font:16@sm token language-html">
            <span className="token tag"><span className="token tag"><span className="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span className="token attr-name">class</span><span className="token attr-value"><span className="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span className="token punctuation">"</span>sm:hover:bg-[#ceb195] …<span className="token punctuation">"</span></span><span className="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
        </code>
    </DemoPanel>
</Demo>
(o) Light up your class names in markup from now on!
<Demo $py={0}>
    <DemoPanel>
        <InlineCode lang="html" className="font:16@sm">{'<div class="bg:#ceb195:hover@sm …">'}</InlineCode>
    </DemoPanel>
</Demo>
This feature is included in the [Master CSS Language Service](/guide/language-service).

### Reliable Code Linting
Have you ever felt anxious about adding styles to class attributes? Master CSS was the first to introduce [syntax validation](/guide/code-linting#syntax-error-checks) of classes in template markup, which helps you find errors early before building and dramatically improves the developer experience.
<Image className="aspect:2/1 r:2x max-w:screen-xs w:full" src={require('~/site/public/syntax-error-checks.webp').default} alt="Syntax error checks" unoptimized />

(x) <span className="text:error">Invalid value for \`font\` property.</span>
```html
<div class="**font:**">…</div>
```
This is just a piece of cake; we also allow you to **enforce consistent class ordering**, **legitimate class checks**, **class collision checks**, and checks for JavaScript utilities like **`clsx()`**.

To learn more, check out the [Code Linting](/guide/code-linting) documentation.
