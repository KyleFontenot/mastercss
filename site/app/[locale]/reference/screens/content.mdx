## Default [sr-only]
<Default />
The `screen` in the variable is a reserved section. In addition to being used as a property value token `screen-*`, it also serves as a responsive breakpoint `@*`.

---

## Basic usage
### Apply a screen size
Apply default screen variables using any syntax, such as [`width`](/reference/width) and [`max-width`](/reference/max-width).
```html
<div class="**w:screen-sm** **max-w:screen-lg**">…</div>
```

### Apply a responsive breakpoint
Conditionally apply styles using default screen variables as responsive breakpoints.
```html
<div class="font:24 font:32**@sm** font:48**@md**">…</div>
```
The responsive breakpoints can be flexibly used with operators, see the [responsive design](/guide/responsive-design) documentation.
