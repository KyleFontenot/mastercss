## Using the animations API
Master CSS keyframes work by parsing the `animation` and `animation-name` component values and generating the corresponding CSS keyframe into the stylesheet.

For example, apply the custom `animation1` using the [animation](/docs/animation) syntax:
```html
<div class="**@animation1|.5s**"></div>
```
Next, compare the differences between **Master CSS** and **traditional CSS** in defining CSS keyframes.

(x) Customizing your keyframes the traditional way causes bloated CSS files.
```css name=main.css
+ @keyframes animation1 { … }
+ @keyframes animation2 { … }
+ …
```
This works fine, but even if you only used one `animation1` of the keyframes, the other unused ones would still be included in the final output and runtime style sheet.

(o) Customize your keyframes using the Master CSS [animations API](/docs/animations).
```js name=master.css.js
export default {
    animations: {
+        animation1: { … },
+        animation2: { … },
+        …
    }
}
```
It generates CSS according to the syntax `@animation1|.5s` you apply:
```css
@keyframes animation1 { … }

.\@animation1\|\.5s {
    animation: animation1 .5s
}
```

Even though there are thousands of predefined keyframes, `animation1`, `animation2`, …, they are not included in the final stylesheet like traditional CSS.
