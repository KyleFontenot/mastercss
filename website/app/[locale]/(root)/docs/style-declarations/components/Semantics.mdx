export const code1 = `<p class="**text-transform:capitalize** **position:absolute** **display:block** **border-radius:50%**">`
export const code2 = `<p class="**capitalize** **abs** **block** **round**">`

Syntax: <code className="token language-mcss"><span className="token mcss"><span className="token Mvalue">semantic</span></span></code>

Writing the native CSS directly makes your markup verbose.
<Code lang="html">
    {code1}
</Code>

(o) Use built-in semantic classes to simplify markup. <Dropped p1={code1} p2={code2} target="class" />
<Code lang="html">
    {code2}
</Code>

When the characteristics of a native CSS property can be accurately conveyed through its value alone, we [utilize the value directly as a semantic class](/docs/semantics#default-reference). For example, we reduce `mcss display:block` to simply `mcss block`.

However, we do not reduce `mcss font-weight:lighter` to `mcss lighter` can be too ambiguous, potentially referring to brightness rather than `font-weight`.

In addition, several useful semantic classes are provided, such as [screen readers](/docs/screen-readers) and [text size](/docs/text-size) with line height, etc.

Semantics effectively reduce markup complexity, improve readability, and maintain the intended meaning of the property.
