## Foreword [sr-only]
The Master CSS [Language Server](/reference/language-server) and [ESLint plugin](/reference/eslint) both support the monorepo development strategy.

By default, the language server will form independent workspaces based on the location of the __master.css.*__ configuration files, independent of the package manager's workspace. The same goes for ESLint, which forms a new working directory based on the location of its configuration file.

Officially integrated packages or extensions will automatically read the __master.css.*__ configuration based on the current running directory. This means that you can start using it with zero configuration as long as you create a configuration file in the workspace.

---

## One root master.css.js
Whether it's a single repository or a monorepo, create a __master.css.js__ file in the root directory for your design system.
```treeview
🗂️ src
📄 eslint.config.js
📄 master.css.js
```
The language service will create at least a root workspace regardless of whether `master.css.*` exists.

---

## One master.css.js per microservice
When there are different design systems or complex requirements in a monorepo, you may need to create __master.css.js__ and __eslint.config.js__ for multiple folders.

(i) This will create two workspaces, `/` and `/apps/a`.
```treeview
🗂️ apps
|-- 🗂️ a
|   |-- 📄 eslint.config.js
|   `-- 📄 master.css.js
`-- 🗂️ b
📄 eslint.config.js
📄 master.css.js
```
Note that `/apps/b` will be considered part of the root workspace `/`.

### Shared the configuration
In each workspace, you need to export the common root configuration.
```ts name=apps/a/master.css.js
export { default } from '../../master.css'
```
Or extend it and add workspace-specific customization options.
```ts name=apps/a/master.css.js
import common from '../../master.css'

export default {
    extends: [
        common
    ],
    ...
}
```
Regardless of whether there is a specific workspace configuration, exporting the configuration is necessary when the workspace exists in __eslint.config.js__.

(x) Forgot to create __/apps/a/master.css.js__ in the workspace and export the root configuration.
```treeview
🗂️ apps
|-- 🗂️ a
|   |-- 📄 eslint.config.js
-|   `-- 📄 master.css.js
`-- 🗂️ b
📄 eslint.config.js
📄 master.css.js
```
Unless this workspace is not using Master CSS, this is a common oversight.
